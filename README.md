# Edyoda_Assignment1

In this repository, I have included all the files separately as well as collectively in one file named all_in_one.py.
One can run the file - all_in_one.py, and can get same results as running the files separately.

I have used a more basic fundamental of Mathematics in question no-10, which might not be expected by the examiner. But why waste energy as well as resources, when a task can be done in more simpler way.

P.S. I have constrained myself to the concepts of data types only. Most of the questions could be solved more efficiently using other advanced concepts of Python.
